- Extreme class imbalance (0.13% fraud rate)  
- Leakage-controlled train/test pipeline  
- SMOTE vs class-weight comparison (training-only application)  
- Precision, Recall, PR-AUC evaluation  
- Threshold optimisation for recall-driven risk reduction  
- Governance and model validation documentation

## Work Experience

### Graduate Engineer Trainee (Data Analyst) | HCL Tech | Dec 2022 – Jun 2023 | Delhi, India

- Processed large, multi-source operational and pricing datasets by cleaning, validating, and standardising raw inputs using Python (Pandas) and SQL to resolve missing values and schema inconsistencies, improving data reliability and reducing downstream reporting errors by 25%.  
- Developed short-term pricing and trend forecasts by applying Linear Regression and time-based analysis on cleaned datasets, enabling more accurate forecasts and supporting data-driven pricing decisions for business stakeholders.  
- Automated end-to-end data preparation, extraction, and reporting by integrating SQL pipelines, Python scripts, and Excel workflows and delivering insights via Power BI and Tableau dashboards, reducing manual processing time by 30% and accelerating decision-making for operations and management teams.
