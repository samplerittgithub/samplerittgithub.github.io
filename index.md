## About

I build analytics systems focused on fraud detection, financial risk modelling, and operational performance optimisation.

My work combines structured data validation, domain-driven feature engineering, imbalance-aware modelling, and stakeholder-ready reporting using Python, SQL, and Power BI, with an emphasis on production readiness and risk control rather than academic experimentation.

## Flagship Project

### Production-Oriented Fraud Risk Detection System

High-volume financial transaction modelling (6.3M+ records)

- Extreme class imbalance (0.13% fraud rate)  
- Leakage-controlled train/test pipeline  
- SMOTE vs class-weight comparison (training-only application)  
- Precision, Recall, PR-AUC evaluation  
- Threshold optimisation for recall-driven risk reduction  
- Governance and model validation documentation  

A complete production-oriented repository — including modular pipeline implementation, performance evaluation artefacts, and governance documentation — is currently under final development.
