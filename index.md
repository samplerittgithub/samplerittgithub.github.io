## About

I design analytics systems focused on fraud detection, financial risk modelling, and operational performance optimisation using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

## Flagship Project

### Production-Oriented Fraud Risk Detection System

- 6.3M+ financial transactions  
- 0.13% fraud rate imbalance  
- Leakage-controlled ML pipeline  
- Threshold optimisation (recall-driven risk reduction)  
- Governance documentation  

A complete production-oriented repository — including modular pipeline implementation, performance evaluation outputs, and model risk documentation — is currently under final development.
